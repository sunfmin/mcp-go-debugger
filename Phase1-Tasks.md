## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Must have for Phase 1 - core functionality that cannot be deferred
- **P1**: Should have for Phase 1 - important but could potentially slip to early Phase 2
- **P2**: Nice to have for Phase 1 - enhances the experience but could be deferred

## Next Steps After Phase 1

- [ ] Review Phase 1 implementation and gather feedback
- [ ] Identify any issues or limitations that need to be addressed
- [ ] Begin planning for Phase 2 implementation of enhanced features
- [ ] Consider early adopter testing with selected users
